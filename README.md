# Project Overview
 
 *Taxicabs are the only vehicles that have the right to pick up street-hailing and prearranged passengers anywhere in New York City. The yellow and green taxi trip records include fields capturing pick-up and drop-off dates/times, pick-up and drop-off locations, trip distances, itemized fares, rate types, payment types, and driver-reported passenger counts. The data used in the attached datasets were collected and provided to the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC).*
